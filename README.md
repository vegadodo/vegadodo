SNUCSE 19. I play bass. I code for fun (I guess). A developer at [Jjalkey](https://jjalkey.com).

## Fun stuff about me

- I was on a TV show ***[Infinite Challenge](https://youtu.be/YwTQexnpau8?t=321)*** when I was 11. You can see me talk right after the video starts, and do some quiz in the next round. My two younger brothers have also been on TV.
- I modeled for promotional photos of HAFS (my high school) in 2017.
- I starred in [***"Off Road Jam"*** MV](https://youtu.be/u6aKcFBRVxA), directed and shot by my brother [seoulthesoloist](https://instagram.com/seoulthesoloist). It's a great song by [Mudd the student](https://instagram.com/muddthestudent), and you can see me in red hair.
- I starred in [***"Kamehameha"*** MV](https://youtu.be/iRTuOYb1XmQ), directed by my brother [seoulthesoloist](https://instagram.com/seoulthesoloist). It's a great song by [Balming Tiger](https://balmingtiger.com), and you can see drunk me in the left corner.
