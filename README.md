SNUCSE 19. I play bass. I code for fun (I guess).

## My development environment

- macOS
- Visual Studio Code
- Git + PGP Key (for that shiny `Verified` badge)

## Keyboard layouts I use

- `Colemak` (Have been using since 2020.)
- `3-Set Korean` (Have been using since 2016.)
- `Dvorak` (Currently trying to return to Dvorak.)
- I originally changed my layout from `Qwerty` to `Dvorak` in 2016, then had used `Dvorak` until 2019. In 2019, due to issues related to shortcuts, I changed my layout back to `Qwerty` and used it until 2020. Then, in 2020 I converted to `Colemak`, and has been using it since.

## Programming languages (or that sort of things) I've used so far

- Assembly (LC-3)
- C
- C++
- Java
- LaTeX
- Python
- R
- Scala

## Languages I speak

- Korean (Native)
- English (Quite fluent)
- Japanese (Intermediate)
