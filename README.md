SNUCSE 19. I play bass. I code for fun (I guess).

## My development environment

- macOS
- Visual Studio Code
- Git + PGP Key (for that shiny `Verified` badge)

## Keyboard layouts I used so far

### Previously

- `Qwerty`: -2016, 2019-2020
- `Colemak`: 2020-2021
- `2-Set Korean`: -2016

### Currently

- `Dvorak`: 2016-2019, 2021-
- `3-Set Korean`: 2016-
- I originally changed my layout from `Qwerty` to `Dvorak` in 2016, then had used `Dvorak` until 2019. In 2019, due to issues related to shortcuts, I changed my layout back to `Qwerty` and used it until 2020. Then, in 2020 I converted to `Colemak`, and have used it until 2021. In 2021, I changed back to `Dvorak` again.

## Programming languages (or that sort of things) I've used so far

- Assembly (LC-3)
- C
- C++
- Java
- LaTeX
- Python
- R

## Languages I speak
