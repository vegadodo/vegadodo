SNUCSE 19. I play bass. I code for fun (I guess).

## Fun stuff about me

- I was on a TV show ***[Infinite Challenge](https://youtu.be/YwTQexnpau8?t=321)*** when I was 11. You can see me talk right after the video starts, and do some quiz in the next round. My two younger brothers have also been on TV.

## Boring stuff about me

- Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, Natural Science Program. 2016-2019
- Seoul National University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. 2019-present (Currently on Military Leave of Absence)
- ROK Air Force, English Translator. 2021-05-10--2023-02-09

## My development environment

- macOS
- Visual Studio Code
- Git + PGP Key (for that shiny `Verified` badge)

## Keyboard layouts I used so far

### Previously

- `Qwerty`: until 2016, 2019-2020
- `Colemak`: 2020-2021
- `2-Set Korean`: until 2016

### Currently

- `Dvorak`: 2016-2019, 2021-present
- `3-Set Korean`: 2016-present
- I originally changed my layout from `Qwerty` to `Dvorak` in 2016, then had used `Dvorak` until 2019. In 2019, due to issues related to shortcuts, I changed my layout back to `Qwerty` and used it until 2020. Then, in 2020 I converted to `Colemak`, and have used it until 2021. In 2021, I changed back to `Dvorak` again.
